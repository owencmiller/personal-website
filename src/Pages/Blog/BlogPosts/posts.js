    &emsp; &emsp; First stop is Acadia National Park in Maine! Great hiking, awesome views, and I'm learning a lot about living in a van. So 
    far the hardest parts have been finding a place to park and dealing with smelly hiking shoes. Nonetheless, so far so good!

    &emsp; &emsp; Second stop was Cuyahoga Valley National Park in Ohio! More good hiking and some interesting history. There was a beautiful stream 
    with only an couple of inches of water running through it which made the classic "babbling brook" sound. Two parks down and a lot more to go!

    &emsp; &emsp; Third stop was Indiana Dunes National Park! About an hour hike out to a beautiful quiet beach on Lake Michigan was totally worth it.
    The 90 degree heat made the trek difficult, but I learned a lot about the biomes in the area and that reapplying sunblock is essential.

    &emsp; &emsp; My fourth stop was Voyaguer National Park up in Northern Minnesota! The park was massive and had some amazing hiking. I met a couple who 
    also lived in their van and they gave me plenty of great tips! I didn't bring my camera on my long hike becuase I wanted to just enjoy the park, 
    so there aren't many photos from this park. Nonetheless, I'm now off to North Dakota!

    &emsp; &emsp; Rocky Mountain National Park is one of the best so far. Hiking 1,400 feet up and a distance of 6 miles was well worth it.
    I had the top of Deer Mountain all to myself for about 20 minutes. Next up is Great Sand Dunes National Park!
